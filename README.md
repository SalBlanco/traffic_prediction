# Traffic Prediction

This project explores the efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the prediction of traffic density within a network of sensor locations. Deep learning methods are particularly
apt at detecting complex relationships between features; when it comes to traffic, it is imperative to consider the spatial and temporal factors that come into play when modeling
the changes over time. We utilize data from the state of California, namely
the METR-LA dataset, which contains over 10,000 samples of traffic density at 207 sensor locations. Results show that encoding both spatial and temporal features produce a robust model that accounts for the volatility of the data.
